# Sharing

## POST `/api/1/vehicles/{id}/command/share`

Sends a location for the car to start navigation or play a video in theatre mode.

These docs take from the Android app, which sends the data in JSON form. However, a urlencoded POST body will work as well. The basic format to a request looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "share_ext_content_raw",
  "value": {
    "android.intent.extra.TEXT": "123 Main St, City, ST 12345\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/X"
  },
  "locale": "en-US",
  "timestamp_ms": "1539465730"
}
```

Note: This API was previously `navigation_request`, but has been updated to support video links as well.
